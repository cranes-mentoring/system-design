### Introduction to System Design

#### Lesson Objectives:
- Familiarization with the objectives and structure of the course
- Introduction to the concept of system design
- Overview of a project to develop a flower shop service
- Review of technologies and tools used

#### What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system. It involves decisions regarding data structure, modular decomposition, interfaces between system components, and the technology stack. The primary goal of system design is to create a system that meets functional requirements while also being efficient under load, scalable, and easy to maintain.

#### Project Overview

As part of this educational project, we will be developing a service for a flower shop. This will allow us to apply system design knowledge in practice, covering various aspects of creating and launching a real product. Throughout the project, we will encounter tasks related to database design, performance optimization, infrastructure scalability, security provisioning, and more.

#### Technologies Used

Throughout the course, we will utilize the following set of technologies and tools:
- **REST API** for creating web services
- **PostgreSQL** as the database management system
- **Memcached** for implementing caching
- **Kafka** as a stream processing system
- **MongoDB** for storing unstructured data
- **Redis** for distributed caching
- **Istio** for managing service-oriented architecture

#### Homework

1. **Learn the basics of REST API**: Read about REST architecture, its principles, and HTTP request methods.
2. **Familiarize yourself with PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL and try creating a basic table.
3. **Think about the project**: What are the key functional requirements you would propose for the flower shop service? Create a simple document outlining these.

In the next lesson, we will begin by analyzing and planning our project, defining key requirements, and designing the architecture of our system.
