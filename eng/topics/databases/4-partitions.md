### Lesson: Deep Dive into Table Partitioning in PostgreSQL

#### Introduction
Table partitioning is a powerful database performance management technique that allows breaking down large tables into smaller, manageable parts. This can significantly improve query performance and simplify data maintenance. In PostgreSQL, partitioning is natively supported and can be implemented in several ways.

#### Understanding Partitioning
Partitioning divides one table into several physical segments called partitions. Each partition can be optimized for specific queries or maintenance operations, such as purging data after its retention period expires.

#### Types of Partitioning in PostgreSQL
1. **Range Partitioning**: Data is divided into partitions based on specified range values of a column. This is ideal for time series data.
2. **List Partitioning**: Data is divided into partitions according to a list of values. This suits categorized data that can be easily grouped.
3. **Hash Partitioning**: Data is evenly distributed across partitions based on a hash function. This is useful for evenly distributing data.

#### Implementing Partitioning Based on user_uuid
##### Preliminary Considerations
Before partitioning, it's important to ensure that `user_uuid` is suitable for this. Since UUIDs are typically uniformly distributed, hash partitioning may be a good choice for evenly distributing data across partitions.

##### Steps to Create a Partitioned Table

1. **Creating the Parent Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     user_uuid UUID NOT NULL,
     username TEXT NOT NULL,
     email TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL
   ) PARTITION BY HASH (user_uuid);
   ```

2. **Creating Partitions**:
   Decide how many partitions you need based on the expected data volume and server configuration. Suppose we chose 4 partitions:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users_part1 PARTITION OF users FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 0);
   CREATE TABLE users_part2 PARTITION OF users FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 1);
   CREATE TABLE users_part3 PARTITION OF users FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 2);
   CREATE TABLE users_part4 PARTITION OF users FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);
   ```

#### Benefits of Partitioning
- **Improved Query Performance**: Queries that operate within one or several partitions can be faster due to reduced data volume.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Data deletion can be done by dropping an entire partition, which is much faster than deleting rows from a non-partitioned table.

#### Best Practices
- **Choosing a Partitioning Key**: It is important to select a column that provides an even data distribution and matches frequent queries.
- **Determining the Number of Partitions**: Avoid creating too many partitions, as this can negatively impact performance.

#### Homework
- Partition an existing table with user data by `user_uuid` using hash partitioning.
- Implement partitioning for your `users` table assuming it contains a significant amount of data.
- Evaluate the performance change in typical queries before and after partitioning.
