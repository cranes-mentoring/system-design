### SQL Database Transaction Isolation Levels
#### Introduction

Transaction isolation levels define the degree to which changes made by one transaction are visible to other transactions. In SQL databases, there are several isolation levels, each with unique characteristics and impacts on transaction behavior. In this lesson, we will explore each isolation level in detail with examples and descriptions.

#### Isolation Level: READ UNCOMMITTED

The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level allows transactions to see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. This isolation level offers the lowest level of data protection and can lead to the reading of "dirty data."

**Example**: Consider a `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Now, consider two transactions:

```sql
-- Transaction A
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET name = 'Alice' WHERE id = 1;

-- Transaction B
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

In this case, Transaction B can read the modified data (e.g., the name "Alice") even if Transaction A has not yet committed its changes.

#### Isolation Level: READ COMMITTED

The READ COMMITTED isolation level ensures that transactions only see committed changes. Transactions running concurrently with others do not see uncommitted changes.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Transaction A
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

-- Transaction B
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 2;
```

Here, Transaction B will not see the changes made by Transaction A until they are committed.

#### Isolation Level: REPEATABLE READ

The REPEATABLE READ isolation level ensures that transactions see the same data throughout their execution, even if other transactions make changes to that data.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Transaction A
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 3;

-- Transaction B
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET name = 'Charlie' WHERE id = 3;
COMMIT;

-- Transaction A (again)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 3;
```

In this case, the results of the first and second queries in Transaction A will be the same, even though Transaction B has made changes.

#### Isolation Level: SERIALIZABLE

The SERIALIZABLE isolation level provides the highest level of isolation, ensuring that transactions execute as if they were sequential rather than concurrent. This isolation level prevents anomalies such as lost updates and phantom reads.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Transaction A
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 4;

-- Transaction B
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET name = 'Dave' WHERE id = 4;
COMMIT;

-- Transaction A (again)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 4;
```

In this case, the results of the first and second queries in Transaction A will be the same, even if Transaction B has made changes.

#### Conclusion

Transaction isolation levels provide different levels of guarantees regarding the visibility of changes for concurrent transactions. Understanding these levels allows developers to choose the most suitable level for their applications based on data integrity and performance requirements.
