### Lesson: Data Sharding in PostgreSQL

#### Introduction to Data Sharding

Sharding is a method of dividing and distributing data across different databases or servers (shards), which helps improve system performance and scalability. In PostgreSQL, sharding is often implemented manually or using third-party tools due to limited native support for horizontal sharding.

#### When to Use Data Sharding

Data sharding becomes practical in the following scenarios:

- **Large Data Volumes**: When data volume becomes too large to efficiently store and process on a single server.

- **High Read and Write Loads**: When a single server cannot efficiently handle all requests due to a large number of users and operations.

- **Scalability Requirements**: When future data or load growth is anticipated.

#### Example Implementation of Sharding in PostgreSQL

Let's assume we have a `orders` table containing order data that we want to shard based on `user_id`.

##### Step 1: Designing Sharding Scheme

Before starting sharding, it's necessary to define the data splitting method. In this example, we'll use hash sharding to evenly distribute data.

##### Step 2: Creating Shards

Create three databases (shards) to store parts of the `orders` table data.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE orders_shard_1;
CREATE DATABASE orders_shard_2;
CREATE DATABASE orders_shard_3;
```

In each of these databases, create an identical `orders` table to store data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL
);
```

##### Step 3: Writing Data Distribution Function

Create a PL/pgSQL function that determines which shard a record should go into based on `user_id`.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_shard_for_user(user_id INT) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
    IF (user_id % 3) = 0 THEN
        RETURN 'orders_shard_1';
    ELSIF (user_id % 3) = 1 THEN
        RETURN 'orders_shard_2';
    ELSE
        RETURN 'orders_shard_3';
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

##### Step 4: Inserting Data with Sharding Consideration

When inserting new data, determine which shard to write to. Modify your application to use the `get_shard_for_user` function or use a proxy server to route requests to the appropriate shards.

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, order_data, created_at)
VALUES (123, '{"product": "flower", "quantity": 2}', NOW())
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

##### Step 5: Querying Data with Sharding Consideration

When querying data, also consider from which shard to read. If you know which shard `user_id` belongs to, direct the query to the corresponding database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders_shard_1.orders WHERE user_id = 123;
```

#### Best Practices for Data Sharding

- **Monitoring and Balancing**: Regularly monitor data distribution and shard loads for optimal system operation.

- **Backup Strategy**: Ensure regular backups of data from each shard to ensure data safety and recovery.

- **Security**: Ensure secure access to data by managing access rights and ensuring data protection in each shard.

Data sharding is a powerful tool for managing growing data volumes and improving database performance. Implementing sharding in PostgreSQL requires careful planning and configuration, but when done correctly, it enables high database performance and scalability.
